# "Calendar"
A smart calendar that acts like a personal assistant.
This is a web app that will act like a user personal asistent through
the "calendar-events".In this project I worked with Spring Boot, 
Thymeleaf and MYSQL database. the things that are important to the 
user will be saved to the database.

Requirements:
Gradle - thymeleaf, web, jpa, java
